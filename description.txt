--------- Make every consumable item infinite ---------
Collect enough a consumable item to make it infinite, and not consume it!
Depending of the item, this requirement may vary.
There are a wide variety of categorie for all sorts of consumables (usables, placeables, materials and more) each with their own sub-categories.
You can also use the journey research cost of items as their infinities.
Works with modified max stack and most (if not all) modded items.

------------ No more item duplication -------------
*** WORK IN PROGRESS, BREAKS EASILY ***
NPCs, Tiles, walls, etc dropping an item when destroyed, killed, etc won't drop if they were infinite when used.
Include all placeable, critter, and other items.

----------- Alter the behaviour of the mod -----------
Edit the `Infinity Requirements` config to modify the behaviour of the mod!
Toggle on/off certain categories and features of the mods.
Check and change infinities (use negative values for stacks, e.g.: 5 <=> 5 items, -5 <=> 5 stacks).
Add customs for items with incorrect categories (create an issue on the github if needed so in I can fix it).


---------- Detect the category of most items ----------
If an item's category cannot be determined with the items's stats, it will be found when the item is used!
This should work for almost every summoner, player booster and more.
Edit the `Auto Categories` config to modify disable this or clear all the detected categories!

--------- Easely see the infinities of an item ----------
The infinities of every item can be displayed in various ways: 
 - In its tooltip via colored lines. This can also be used to display the categories and requirements of item.
 - On the item sprite via glow. Not that it can sometimes be hard to see.
 - In the item slot via colored dots.
Edit the `Infinity Display` config to change which one is active and display aditional informations or change the color of the infinities.
