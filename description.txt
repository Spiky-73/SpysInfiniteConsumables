        Make every consumable item infinite

Collect enough a consumable item to make it infinite, and not consume it!
Depending of the item, this requirement may vary.
There are a wide variety of categorie for all sorts of consumables (usables, placeables, materials and more) each with their own sub-categories.
You can also use the journey research cost of items as their infinities.
Works with modified max stack and most (if not all) modded items.


        No more item duplication

***WORK IN PROGRESS, DOES NOT WORK FOR TILES***

NPCs, Tiles, walls, etc dropping an item when destroyed, killed, etc won't drop if they were infinite when used.
Include all placeable, critter, and other items.

Edit the `Settings and Requirements` config to modify the behaviour of the mod!
Toggle on/off certain categories and key features of the mods.
Blacklist consumables if necessary.


        Easely see the infinities of an item

The infinities of every item can be displayed in various ways: 
 - In its tooltip via colored lines. This can also be used to display the categories and requirements of item.
 - On the item sprite via glow. Not that it can sometimes be hard to see.
 - In the item slot via colored dots.

Edit the `Infinities Display` config to change which one is active and display aditional informations or change the color of the infinities.

        Automaticaly detect the category of almost all items

If an item's category cannot be determined with the items's stats, it will be determined when the item is used!
This should work for almost every summoner, player booster and more.
Edit the `Category Detection` config to modify disable this or clear all the detected categories!
