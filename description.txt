--------- Make every consumable item infinite ---------
Collect enough a consumable item to make it infinite, and not consume it!
Depending of the item, this requirement may vary.
There are a wide variety of categorie for all sorts of consumables (consumables, placeables, materials and more) each with their own sub-categories.
You can also use the journey research cost of items as their infinities.
Works with modified max stack and most (if not all) modded items.

------------ No more item duplication -------------
*** WORK IN PROGRESS, BREAKS EASILY ***
NPCs, Tiles, walls, etc dropping an item when destroyed, killed, etc won't drop if they were infinite when used.
Include all placeable, critter, and other items.

----------- Alter the behaviour of the mod -----------
Edit the Infinity config to modify the behaviour of the mod!
Toggle on/off certain categories and features of the mods.
Check and change infinities (use negative values for stacks, e.g.: 5 = 5 items, -5 = 5 stacks).
Add customs for items with incorrect categories (create an issue on the github if needed so in I can fix it).

---------- Detect the category of most items ----------
If an item's category cannot be determined with the items's stats, it will be found when the item is used!
This should work for almost every summoner, player booster and other items.
Edit the Auto Categories config to modify disable this or clear all the detected categories!

------------ See what the mod is doing -------------
Edit the Auto Categories config to display various infos used by the mod!
By default, infinte items will be colored and their tooltip will change.
In addition, the category and requirement of items can be showed by enabling toogles.
